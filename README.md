# highlight

Yet another `highlight` command for source highlighting. It uses [Shiki](https://shiki.style/). Its command-line options mimic those of [GNU Source-highlighting](https://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/) partially so that it can be used with [soupault](https://soupault.app/).

This program is created for [blog.anqou.net](https://blog.anqou.net/).
